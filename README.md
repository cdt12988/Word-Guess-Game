## Game Features

### Categories

Players can select from a variety of categories, each with at least 50 different words in their word bank, or they can instead choose to play a random category.  

### Gameplay

Players guess letters to see if they appear in the word or phrase displayed.  If they do, the letters are revealed.  Otherwise, a stick-figure is slowly drawn hanging from the gallows.  The game continues until the player guesses all the letters in the phrase, or the stick figure is completely drawn.

### Game Tracking

The game keeps tracks of the userâ€™s wins, losses and current winning streak.  Messages also appear throughout the game in response to what the player does.
